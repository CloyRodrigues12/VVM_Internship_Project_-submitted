
# Project Description
This project involves developing an **academic dashboard** that provides a centralized platform to manage and visualize student and fee-related information. Users can **upload student and fee records** in bulk via **CSV or Excel files**, which are validated and stored in the database.

The dashboard presents data in a **visual and interactive format**, allowing administrators to:

- View and manage **student details** such as personal information, enrollment data, and academic progress.
- Monitor and analyze **fee-related information**, including paid, pending, and overdue fees.
- Track trends and summaries using **charts and key metrics**.
- Ensure data integrity through validation during file uploads.

The project aims to create an **efficient, user-friendly, and scalable system** that simplifies academic data management while supporting informed decision-making.
